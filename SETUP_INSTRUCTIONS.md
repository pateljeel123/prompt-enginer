## 1. Install Dependencies

Dependencies are already installed, but if you need to reinstall:

## 2. Environment Configuration

The `.env.local` file contains placeholder values. You'll need to update these with real credentials:

### Supabase Setup
1. Go to [Supabase](https://supabase.com) and create a new project
2. In your project dashboard, go to Settings > API
3. Copy your project URL and anon key
4. Update `.env.local`:
   ```env
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_anon_key_here
   SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_service_role_key_here
   ```

### Database Setup
1. In Supabase, go to SQL Editor
2. Copy the contents of `database-setup.sql` and run it
3. This will create all tables, functions, and security policies

### Stripe Setup
1. Create a [Stripe](https://stripe.com) account
2. Get your API keys from the Stripe dashboard
3. Update `.env.local`:
   ```env
   NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_your_publishable_key
   STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_your_secret_key
   STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_your_webhook_secret
   ```

### Stripe Webhook Configuration
1. In Stripe dashboard, go to Developers > Webhooks
2. Add endpoint: `http://localhost:3000/api/stripe-webhook`
3. Select event: `checkout.session.completed`
4. Copy the webhook secret to your `.env.local`
