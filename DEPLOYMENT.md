# AI Prompt Marketplace - Deployment Guide

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ installed
- A Supabase account (free tier works)
- A Stripe account (test mode is fine for development)

### 1. Environment Setup

The application is currently configured with placeholder environment variables. You'll need to replace them with your actual credentials:

#### Supabase Setup
1. Create a new project at [supabase.com](https://supabase.com)
2. Go to Settings > API to get your credentials
3. Update `.env.local` with your Supabase credentials:
   ```env
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_anon_key_here
   SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_service_role_key_here
   ```

#### Stripe Setup
1. Create a Stripe account at [stripe.com](https://stripe.com)
2. Get your test API keys from the Stripe Dashboard
3. Update `.env.local` with your Stripe credentials:
   ```env
   NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_your_key_here
   STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_your_key_here
   STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_your_webhook_secret_here
   ```

### 2. Database Setup

1. In your Supabase project, go to the SQL Editor
2. Copy and paste the contents of `database-setup.sql`
3. Run the SQL script to create all tables, functions, and policies

### 3. Stripe Webhook Configuration

1. In your Stripe Dashboard, go to Developers > Webhooks
2. Add a new endpoint: `http://localhost:3000/api/stripe-webhook`
3. Select the event: `checkout.session.completed`
4. Copy the webhook signing secret to your `.env.local`

### 4. Running the Application

```bash
# Install dependencies (if not already done)
npm install

# Start the development server
npm run dev
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`

## üß™ Testing the Features

### 1. Authentication
- Visit `/login` to create an account or sign in
- Test both email/password and Google authentication (if configured)

### 2. Browse Prompts

- Test the category filtering

### 3. Purchase Flow
- Click on any prompt to view details

### 4. Coin System
- Visit `/buy-coins` to purchase coin packages
- Use Stripe's test card: `4242 4242 4242 4242`
